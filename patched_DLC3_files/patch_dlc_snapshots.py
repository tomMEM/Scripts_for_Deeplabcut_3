Patch for snapshot-??.pt rename crash while training
---------------------------------------------------
Fixes DeepLabCut 3.x FileExistsError:
  [WinError 183] Cannot create a file when that file already exists
Triggered when 'snapshot-best-XXX.pt' already exists during rename.

Usage:
    1. Adjust the path to match your DeepLabCut installation.
    2. Run this script ONCE after installing or updating DeepLabCut.
